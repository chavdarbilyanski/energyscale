Code Review and Improvements for Your BESS Arbitrage System
Based on the provided codebase, I'll focus on key areas relevant to your BESS arbitrage project using Python, MLflow, Django, and deployment (local via Docker Compose and scaling to GCP). I'll highlight bugs/inconsistencies, suggest fixes, and propose enhancements for better performance, accuracy, and deployability. I'll structure this around core components: RL model training/inference, oracle calculation, Django integration, and deployment.

1. Bugs and Inconsistencies in Data Handling and Environment
Decimal Separator Mismatch: In train.py and backtest_rl.py, you're using pd.read_csv(..., decimal=',') in backtest but decimal='.' in train. The comment in train.py says "Corrected decimal separator to comma" but the code uses '.'. This could cause parsing errors if your CSV uses commas for decimals (common in European data like EUR prices).
Fix: Standardize to decimal=',' across all files if prices are formatted like '123,45'. Test with a sample row from your CSV.
Date Format Mismatch: In views.py and services.py, dates are parsed as %d/%m/%Y (e.g., '22/07/2025'). In train.py and backtest_rl.py, it's %m/%d/%y (e.g., '07/22/25'). This will fail on real data.
Fix: Unify to one format based on your CSVs. If mixed, add try-except to attempt both.
Efficiency and Degradation Cost Omitted in Inference: Your RL model is trained with efficiency=0.90 and DEGRADATION_COST=0.01 in batteryEnv.py and train.py, but in services.py (used by Django views), inference assumes 100% efficiency and no degradation. This makes the deployed model behave differently from training, leading to inaccurate profits.
Fix: Update run_rl_model_simulation in services.py:
python

# Add these params (match training)
efficiency = 0.90
degradation_cost_per_action = 0.01  # Or make it per kWh: 0.01 / charge_discharge_rate

# In the BUY block:
amount = min(charge_discharge_rate, max_battery_capacity - battery_charge)
profit_change = -price_kwh * amount - degradation_cost_per_action
battery_charge += amount * efficiency

# In the SELL block:
amount = min(charge_discharge_rate, battery_charge)
profit_change = price_kwh * amount - degradation_cost_per_action
battery_charge -= amount
Log these params in MLflow during training for traceability.
Battery Charge Logging: In services.py, you log battery_charge_before and battery_percent_before, but users might want post-action values for better debugging.
Suggestion: Append both before/after in all_results.
2. Improving the Oracle (Globally Optimal Profit)
Your current heuristic in calculate_globally_optimal_profit (sorting and pairing prices) is a loose upper bound—it ignores time sequencing, battery capacity constraints, and efficiency, often overestimating by 20-50% in real BESS scenarios. For a true oracle (to accurately benchmark RL performance), use linear programming (LP) via PuLP, which optimizes under real constraints (e.g., SOC evolution over time).

Improved Implementation (Replace in services.py):

python

Run

Copy
import pulp

def calculate_globally_optimal_profit(csv_file, max_battery_capacity, charge_discharge_rate, efficiency=0.90, initial_soc=0.0):
    logger.info("Calculating globally optimal profit using LP...")
    
    csv_file.seek(0)
    csv_data = csv_file.read().decode('utf-8')
    df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(csv_data), sep=';', decimal=',')  # Use ',' based on your data
    
    df.rename(columns={'Price (EUR)': 'price', 'Date': 'timestamp', 'Hour': 'hour'}, inplace=True)
    df['price'] = pd.to_numeric(df['price'], errors='coerce')
    df.dropna(inplace=True)
    if df.empty: return 0.0
    
    prices_kwh = df['price'].values / 1000.0  # Convert to EUR/kWh
    T = len(prices_kwh)
    
    # LP Setup
    model = pulp.LpProblem("BESS Optimal Arbitrage", pulp.LpMaximize)
    
    # Variables
    charge = {t: pulp.LpVariable(f"charge_{t}", 0, charge_discharge_rate) for t in range(T)}
    discharge = {t: pulp.LpVariable(f"discharge_{t}", 0, charge_discharge_rate) for t in range(T)}
    soc = {t: pulp.LpVariable(f"soc_{t}", 0, max_battery_capacity) for t in range(T)}
    
    # Constraints
    model += soc[0] == initial_soc + charge[0] * efficiency - discharge[0]
    for t in range(1, T):
        model += soc[t] == soc[t-1] + charge[t] * efficiency - discharge[t]
    
    # Objective: Maximize profit
    profit = pulp.lpSum(prices_kwh[t] * (discharge[t] - charge[t]) for t in range(T))
    model += profit
    
    # Solve (using default CBC solver)
    model.solve(pulp.PULP_CBC_CMD(msg=False))
    
    if pulp.LpStatus[model.status] != 'Optimal':
        logger.warning("No optimal solution found.")
        return 0.0
    
    optimal_profit = pulp.value(profit)
    logger.info(f"[LP Oracle] Optimal profit: {optimal_profit:.2f} EUR")
    return optimal_profit
Why Better?: Accounts for sequential SOC changes, efficiency, and capacity/rate limits. It's the true max profit achievable.
Enhancements: Add degradation cost: Subtract degradation_cost * (charge[t] + discharge[t]) from profit. For large T (>1000), it solves quickly (~seconds). Log solve time/metrics to MLflow.
Integration: Call this in views.py as before. For benchmarking, run it in backtest_rl.py post-simulation and print RL score as (rl_profit / optimal_profit) * 100%.
3. RL Training and Backtesting Enhancements
MLflow Integration: Great start in train.py! Add more logging: After training, evaluate on a holdout dataset and log mlflow.log_metric("eval_profit", eval_profit). Use MLflow for versioning—your register_model is good, but load registered models in services.py via mlflow.pyfunc.load_model("models:/BatteryPPOModel/Production").
Hyperparams: In train.py, experiment with learning_rate=1e-4 or use PPO's callback for early stopping. Track TensorBoard logs in MLflow.
Backtesting: In backtest_rl.py, add the LP oracle call for comparison. Visualize SOC constraints violations (if any).
Scalability: For larger datasets, use SubprocVecEnv instead of DummyVecEnv for parallel training.
4. Django Integration and Models
Forms and Views: forms.py and views.py look solid. Add validation for CSV headers in CSVUploadForm.clean_csv_file(). Store simulations in DB via TradeSimulation model (currently unused)—after processing, create an instance with results=json.dumps(rl_results).
Security: In production, use CSRF for uploads. For GCP, integrate Django with Google Cloud Storage for file uploads instead of local FileField.
Performance: Cache RL model loading (it's expensive)—use a singleton or load once on app start.
5. Deployment: Local and GCP
Local (Docker Compose): Your docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile are production-ready (multi-stage build, non-root user). Fixes:
Add depends_on: [db] for web (uncomment it).
For ml service (training/backtesting), create Dockerfile.ml similar to Dockerfile but with CMD ["python", "train.py"] or entrypoint for MLflow server (mlflow ui).
Run: docker-compose up --build. Use .env for secrets (e.g., DB creds, Django SECRET_KEY).
Issue: ML models copied to /powerbidder/—ensure path matches in load_rl_model_and_env().
GCP Deployment:
Web (Django): Use Cloud Run (serverless). Build/push image to Artifact Registry, deploy with --port=8000 --env-vars-file=.env.yaml. Scale auto.
DB: Migrate to Cloud SQL (Postgres). Update docker-compose for local dev, but in GCP, use connection string in Django settings.
ML (Training/Inference): For training, use Vertex AI (integrates with MLflow). Run jobs via gcloud ai custom-jobs create with your Docker image. For inference, serve model via Vertex AI endpoints—load from MLflow registry.
Storage: Use Cloud Storage for CSVs/models. In services.py, download models from GCS if not local.
Orchestration: Use Cloud Composer (Airflow) for scheduling training/backtests. Monitor with Cloud Logging/Monitoring.
Costs: Start with free tier for Cloud Run/SQL. Enable autoscaling.
CI/CD: Use Cloud Build for auto-deploys on Git pushes.
Next Steps
Test fixes with sample data—focus on efficiency alignment for RL accuracy.
Benchmark RL vs. LP oracle; aim for >80% performance score.
If deploying to GCP, start with gcloud run deploy for the web service.
If this addresses your setup, or if you have a specific issue (e.g., error in training, GCP config), provide more details!

    reward += 0.1 * (price_per_kwh - forecast_avg) * kwh_to_sell  # Profit-aligned bonus

Hybrid BESS + Solar Extension:
Add solar_kWh to obs (e.g., +24 forecasted solar via another LSTM): Prioritize free solar charging in rewards for net profit boost.
Extend obs_space in batteryEnv.py: low_bounds/high_bounds += [0, np.inf]*24.
Train hybrid: Expect +10-20% profit from solar offsets.
